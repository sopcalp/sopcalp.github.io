<div class="about about_index"><h2 id="about-sopcalp">About SOPCALP</h2>

<p>SOPCALP is a faith-based non-for-profit non-governmental organization which operates out of Isiala-Mbano LGA, Imo State Nigeria. Our purpose at SOPCALP is “Bearing the Concerns of the Poor”. Derived from this purpose, “practical skill” development and “community-based and people-centred development approaches” are among our objectives. We have been in operation since 1997.</p>

<p>SOPCALP currently has two long-running programs; a microcredit program and HIV and AIDS program. The HIV and AIDS program is aimed at sensitization about HIV and AIDS, and prevention of spread of HIV. We also work to provide care and support for the infected and affected. The microcredit program is an interest-free loan scheme targeted at local women and youth groups. We work with community leaders such as clergy and local groups to ensure loan repayments. At the centre of this microcredit program is capacity development. Members of the community who are given loans by SOPCALP are usually equipped with the technical and business skills to manage and grow small businesses.</p>

<p>In line with our objectives, community engagement is a key factor in the accomplishment of our tasks. For our projects located within Isiala-Mbano, the symbiotic link SOPCALP possesses with the Diocese of Okigwe North, Anglican Communion, Church of Nigeria is of great benefit. SOPCALP organizes events centred on social work and public service for the diocese.</p>

<p>SOPCALP is registered with the Corporate Affairs Commission, is a member of the Forum for Imo NGOs (FINGO), South-East NGOs (SENGOS) and partners with the Christian Rural and Development Association for Nigeria (CRUDAN).</p>
